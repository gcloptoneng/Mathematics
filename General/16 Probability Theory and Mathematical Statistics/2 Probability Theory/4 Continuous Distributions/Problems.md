# Distribution Function and Density Function

**Suppose a random variable $X$ represents the heights (in centimeters) of adult males in a certain population. Assume that $X$ is normally distributed with a mean $(\mu)$ of $175 \mathrm{~cm}$ and a standard deviation $(\sigma)$ of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$.**
**1. Calculate the probability that a randomly selected adult male from this population is shorter than $165 \mathrm{~cm}$.**
Answer: 0.15865525393145707

**2. Determine the probability that a randomly selected adult male is taller than $185 \mathrm{~cm}$.**
Answer: 0.15865525393145596

**3. Find the probability that a randomly selected adult male has a height between $165 \mathrm{~cm}$ and 185 $\mathrm{cm}$.**
Answer: 0.682689492137087

**4. Plot the probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution and highlight the areas under the curve corresponding to the probabilities you calculated in the previous parts.**
